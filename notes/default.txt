WELCOME TO TRMNOTES!

Very simple, you have all the instrunctions you need on the botttom.
There is more neat commands in the help menu so make sure you check that out (ctrl+h).

This is a simple notetaking app that strictly stays in the terminal.
My inspirtation was nvim but I'm bad at vim controls so I made this.

Basic overview:
On the left is the file explorer, shows all the different notes you have.
You can open other files by doing ctrl+O, if you want to make a new file just do ctrl+N.
To delete a file is ctrl+d.
You can toggle the file explorer by pressing ctrl+E.

The editor section is the area you type in. You can make multiple lines and get around using the arrow keys. (mouse soon to come)
Only ascii characters work so keep that in mind (maybe markdown support in the future? still debating).

On the right you have line number, it highlights which line you are currently on in a different color (color depends on system and themeing).

On the bottom you have some basic important controls. Also tells you ur cursor pos.
The numbers are highlited based off whether or not u are at the end of the possible index of that line (so at the very end of the line the x pos should be red or color depends)

If you evey need help just make sure to check the help menu with ctrl+H.

Enjoy using my app!
